What am I up to? I'm learning Mongo. I'm keeping this here repository because I learn a lot. When one learns as much as I do and as often as I do; sometimes things like this help. Okay - they always help.

Here we are having the results of the Python blog project that's presented with Mongo/Python coursewhere.

The newest releases of Mongo require a 64 bit operating system and I didn't feel like going Paas, so I went [with a VM] (http://askubuntu.com/questions/298290/smbus-bios-error-while-booting-ubuntu-in-virtualbox/778466#778466)

They put me on the [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) framework. _I didn't write it down; but something about getting Python/Pip on Linux 64 was special. Hrm... I think I ended up using a github installation followed by apt-get for pippy. Oh the pain..._

There's a mention of using PyCharm... I've installed it but I've not really used it yet. Might when I get up to code.

I think that's about it for now. The title is totally going to change when I'm ready to upload files to it. Right now I'm off to do more playing.
